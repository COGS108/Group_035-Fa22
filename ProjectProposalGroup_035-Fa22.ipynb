    "    * What is Instant Ramen? Instant Ramen is a staple food for college students and busy people throughout the world. People eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and at any time of the day. Instant Ramen is a cheap option and consists of precooked noodles with some type of flavor powder. It is common around the world and each country has a favorite brand. Some famous brands are NongShim, Indomie, and Maruchan. \n",
    "    - This topic is very significant to our group because as college students we all have tried various types of noodles. We love food and want to share our love of food and combine it with data science. We have looked deep into our dataset and categorized it with brands, countries, and ratings. \n",
    "    - We are curious to see if the spice level of instant ramen can have an effect on the rating deepening in the different countries it is tried in. We know that some countries prefer spicy food so possibly the spicier instant ramens has a higher rating three, whilst countries that cannot tolerate much spice may have a greater rating for less spicier flavors. \n",

    "References can be research publications, but they need not be. Blogs, GitHub repositories, company websites, etc., are all viable references if they are relevant to your project. It must be clear which information comes from which references. (2-3 paragraphs, including at least 2 references)\n"

    "1. Explain what the **ideal** dataset you would want to answer this question. (This should include: What variables? How many observations? Who/what/how would these data be collected? How would these data be stored/organized?)\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is quite clear to the audience that they can imagine themselves. An ideal dataset should contain the average rating from a random sample instant ramen noodle. An ideal dataset should include the variables: 1) spiciness level 2) country origin 3) average rating from a random sample population. Ideally, we should have all types of ramen in our dataset. We would want to see the organization's name and its original country that produces the ramen. Within those products, we will see the package name and also how spicy it is. It is also important to see how customers would rate those instant ramen when they try them. We should also know the population that rate those ramen since not everyone can try all of them. A record of around more than 1000 rows should be durable enough to analyze. Since the dataset is not to that extent of more than 1 GB, we can store it in a csv file instead of zipping it into json format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Search for potential **real** datasets that could provide you with something useful for this project.  You do not have to find every piece of data you will use, but you do need to have demonstrated some idea that (a) this data is gettable and (b) that this data may be different from what your ideal is\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) A dataset we found is on Kaggle Top Ramen Ratings 2022 . Another one (Ramen Ratings) we use is from 5 years ago when we compare the trend of ratings. Both dataset have the same variables: brand name, variety or ramen package name, style, country and stars. They are well-formatted or cleansed csv files that we can download from Kaggle since they are publicly available. It is quite limited to the fact that there is no indication of the general population rating.*\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) After having researched on how the dataset is made, we found that the ratings come from only 1 person, which is from a guy who has eaten and made an opinion on those ramen surrounding his areas. We do not have average ratings described in our ideal circumstances. Kaggle dataset collected information from The Definitive Guide To Samyang Buldak 2.0 article. How we know that this site is only reviewed by one person is proven from the author’s HOW I REVIEW / DISCLOSURE. Another issue is extracting the spiciness level from “variety” column (text field), which describes the name of the ramen package. We have to make an assumption that certain flavors will be spicy such as “kimchi”, “curry”, “heat”, “hot”."

    "    - According to the original website where the data is collected, the website owner (Hans Lienesch) contacted different instant ramen companies by email and asked for their sample through mail. Because of this way of obtaining the sample noodle, some companies that do not use email as their main method of communication or companies outside of the United States find it more difficult to have their products sent to this reviewer. Besides, he also obtains his instant ramen noodles for review from buying the instant ramen noodles from his local grocery store. Because of this, the instant ramen noodles in the dataset is a biased sample of the noodles that are available in his area.\n",
